# Gorillionaire

This is a fork of select repositories from github.com/gorilla - The Gorilla Web Toolkit.

Gorilla was shuttered at the end of 2022 to many people's shock and dismay. Maintaining the repositories that I rely on seems like less work than major refactors of my projects that utilize their functionality. So, here we are.

----

ü¶ç A helpful toolkit for building HTTP-based applications with the Go programming language.

## Projects

Supported libraries:

* [mux](https://github.com/gorillionaire/mux), a powerful request router for web applications
* [sessions](https://github.com/gorillionaire/sessions), making cookies and session management easy
* [csrf](https://github.com/gorillionaire/csrf), csrf protection middleware
    
## Current Plan

- [x] Fork repos
- [x] Enable discussions
- [] Triage and port over open issues

If you would like another repo maintained (probably websockets) let me know in the Discussions tab. 

If you would like to help out, also let me know. 

## Who is maintaining this?

Former Google engineer. I have about 10 years experience split between software engineering and security engineering. If you are a corporation and are nervous about using this fork feel free to reach out for my Linkedin.
